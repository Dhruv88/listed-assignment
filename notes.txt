Build a vacation auto responder application that has the following functionalities:
● Checks for new emails in any given Gmail ID.
● Replies to emails that have no prior replies.
● Adds a label to the replied email and moves the email to the label.
● Repeats tasks in random intervals of 45 to 120 secs.
● Ensure no double replies are sent to any email at any point of time.

Flow:
1. user provides credentials
2. Login
3. Fetch the mails(Remove no reply mails and only mails received from the start date of code run)
4. Reply to the mails
5. Change Label and remove from inbox
6. Logout
7. Repeat 2-6

To Note: 
Password should be hidden when user enters it and save the encrypted Password

Further Improvements that can be done
1. Send replies in a bulk to make system faster
2. Make the no-reply identification logic stronger and maybe implement an ml model to do the same
3. More improvements in security
